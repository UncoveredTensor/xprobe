This project focuses on the extraction of user input from a specified webpage URL. Leveraging a combination of advanced machine learning techniques and commonly used regex expressions, the project aims to identify and retrieve user input within webpages. The project's objective is to integrate this tool seamlessly with other tools, such as Katana from @projectdiscovery, to enhance the capability of discovering user input based on the URLs crawled by Katana. Users have the option to log the predictions in the terminal or save them to a CSV file for future analysis and utilization. This project presents an innovative solution for efficiently capturing and analyzing user interactions, enabling deeper insights into user behavior and enhancing web experiences.
